# Cookiecutter Bioinformatics

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing bioinformatics work._

This cookiecutter template was developed by the [Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics Bioinformatics Core Facility](https://www.ie-freiburg.mpg.de/bioinformatics) with the aim of establishing a standardized project directory structure within the institute. It is a fork of [cookiecutter-fair-data-science](https://github.com/FAIR4HEP/cookiecutter-fair-data-science), with a healthy dose of [Snakemake workflow best practices](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html#distribution-and-reproducibility) mixed in. There is less focus on building a python package that can train and run machine learning models, but rather on building bioinformatics workflows that can run on the MPI-IE cluster according to [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5+
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```

On the MPI-IE infrastructure, you can also run `module load cookiecutter`. 

### To start a new project, run:
------------

    cookiecutter gh:koppsteinlab/cookiecutter-bioinformatics-project


### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this:
